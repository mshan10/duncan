# Final Project Component Architecture Seed

This repo serves as the seed project for the Parse Auth Module to learn advanced Angular 1.5 architecture and components!

## To Install:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/michaelwicks/final-project-component-architecture-seed.git```

2. Run ```npm install```

3. Make sure ```gulp``` is installed globally

4. Run ```npm start``` or ```gulp```

5. Open Chrome and navigate to ```http://localhost:8880/```

You will notice a small white box load in the lower righthand corner. This box is called the UI-Router Visualizer. It allows you to see the current state of your application. As you add components you will be able to view the component tree in realtime. You can even select components in the tree to navigate during debugging. In this seed project the only component in your tree is the root component.
